# Cursor Rules for Dibble Project

## E2E Testing Workflow

After implementing any new feature or making significant changes to the Dioxus application:

1. **Always run e2e tests to validate the changes** - Use the following command:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Ensure all tests pass before considering work complete** - If tests fail:
   - Investigate the failure
   - Fix any issues introduced by the changes
   - Re-run tests to confirm fixes

3. **Update tests when adding new features** - When adding new functionality:
   - Add corresponding test cases in `tests/test_dioxus_app.py` or create new test files
   - Ensure new features are properly validated

4. **Test execution requirements**:
   - The Dioxus server must be running before tests: `dx serve --platform web`
   - Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
   - All Python test code is isolated in the `tests/` directory

## Testing Command

The standard command to run all e2e tests is:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

To run with verbose output:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

To run a specific test file:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_dioxus_app.py
```

## Test Validation

The e2e tests validate:
- Home page loads and displays content
- Navigation between routes works
- App is fully hydrated and interactive
- Routing system works end-to-end

All tests must pass before marking any feature implementation as complete.
